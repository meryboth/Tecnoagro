# Tecnoagro
Tecnoagro is a virtual reality (VR) experience tailored for learning within the agricultural sector. This application emerged from the dynamic environment of a Hackathon Event hosted by Flock IT in November 2023, where it clinched the top honors.

## Identifying the Problem and Offering a Solution
Tecnoagro aims to revolutionize how agricultural operators and machinery drivers access information and training. Drawing inspiration from Venturino, an Argentine company specializing in John Deere machinery sales, we crafted a solution centered around user experience, enhancing accessibility to operational knowledge and educational resources.

## Technology Stack
- Design and Prototyping: Bezi
- Development: Unity
- UI Design: Figma

The Oculus Quest 2 served as our primary testing and development platform.

## Key Features
Courses: Immerse yourself in VR environments within the machine, facilitating hands-on learning and operational understanding of each component.
Learning Center: Step into an immersive VR space equipped with a spatial dashboard to track course progress, access instructional videos, and monitor your learning journey.
Practices: This section is currently under development.
Settings and Profile: Customize your experience and manage user information effortlessly.

### Running the Project
